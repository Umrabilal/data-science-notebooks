# Heart Disease Prediction
This project predicts the chance of heart disease using data from the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
from cleaning the raw data to training and improving the final model.

## what i Did
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset.
- Split the data into training and testing sets. 
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** model.
- Evaluated and improved the accuracy.
- Saved the trained model for future use.

## Tools and Libraries
Python ,Pandas , Numpy ,Scikit-learn ,Matplotlib ,Pickle.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Install required libraries
3. open the notebook 'heart_disease_prediction.ipynb'
4. Run all cells to see the full workflow

## Results
The model achieved around **79% accuracy** with key features like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure playing major roles.
